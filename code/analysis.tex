\noindent Since the 2012 recall election of Governor Scott Walker, political
polarization in Wisconsin has become a major topic in Wisconin's
politics. Mass polarization among Wisconsin's electorate is well
documented. However, there is little research done on polarization of
political donors and the policy implications of donor polarization. This
study intends to fill this research gap by studying networks of
political donors in Wisconsin. I use data from the Wisconsin Campaign
Finance Information System, Wisconsin's official campaign finance
database, to create networks of donors to candidates for Wisconsin's
state-wide and state-legislative races. By using community modularity, I
empirically show that Republican and Democratic donor networks polarized
in the 2012 election cycle during the recall election of Scott Walker
and remained polarized in the 2014 election cycle in which Governor
Walker was reelected. I also validate these results using a
non-parametric bootrapping method. I discuss the implications of this
conclusion \_\_\_\_\_\_

Political campaign finance plays an important role in the American
political system. This significance is evidenced by the attention that
academic researchers pay to the topic as well as the many different
contexts in which campaign finance is studied. For example, research has
been conducted on the impact of political donations on roll-call voting
in the U.S. Congress (Roscoe and Jenkins 2005; Stratmann 1991), gender
representation in political parties (Crowder-Meyer and Cooperman 2018;
M. Barber, Butler, and Preece 2016; Kitchens and Swers 2016; Thomsen and
Swers 2017), ability to win political campaigns (Bonica 2017; Bonneau
2007), the connection between money raised and public attention (Ellis,
Ripberger, and Swearingen 2017), judicial function (Palmer and Levendis
2008), perceptions of corruption (Bowler and Donovan 2015), political
economy and stock returns (Akey 2015; Fowler, Garro, and Spenkuch 2020;
Cooper, Gulen, and Ovtchinnikov 2010), and the significant amount of
time that candidates and legislators devote to fundraising
(Torres-Spelliscy 2017).

Even though political donors are believed to play an out-sized role in
democracy, the psychological processes of donors is thought to be
similar to voters. Political donations can be thought of an extension of
voting. In other words, both actions are political consumptions that
seek to improve their preferred candidate's chances of winning.
Ansolabehere, de Figueiredo and Snyder summarized this idea by stating,
``In our view, campaign contributing should not be viewed as an
investment, but rather as a form of consumption--or, in the language of
politics, participation'' (Ansolabehere, Figueiredo, and Jr. 2003).
Donations can be seen as an outlet for motivated citizens to increase
their participation beyond just turning out to vote when they perceive
the stakes of elections to be high (Hill and Huber 2017).

The folk-theory of political donors is of smokey backrooms and
access-oriented donors who seek to have a direct influence on policy
making. However, even when donors contribute to legislators that
maximize their economic interests, donations are not found to be
motivated by existing policy agreements and not an expectation of access
(M. J. Barber, Canes-Wrone, and Thrower 2016). Even donations from
business executives have been found to be ``best understood as purchases
of `good will' whose returns, while positive in expectation, are
contingent and rare'' (Gordon, Hafer, and Landa 2007).

Although the psychological process of making a political campaign
contribution can be thought of as similar to voting, there are
significant demographic and ideological differences between donors and
voters. People with lower incomes, less education, and do not work in
professional and managerial jobs are less likely to be politically
engaged, including making political donations (Laurison 2016). Donors to
the Democratic and Republican parties were summarized as being
``Limousine Liberals'' and ``Corporate Conservatives'' (Francia et al.
2005).In addition, Democrats and Republicans draw their bases of
electoral support from different geographic bases. However, major
campaign donors are highly concentrated geographically. These
``big-donor neighborhoods'' are unrepresentative of the country as a
whole and point to these communities having a distinct political culture
(Bramlett, Gimpel, and Lee 2011). In both parties, donors are more
ideologically extreme than non-donating voters, even among primary
voters (Hill and Huber 2017; Francia et al. 2003). Even wealthy donors
who make up the ``big money'' in politics are very partisan (McCarty,
Poole, and Rosenthal 2006).

This ideological extremity shown by political donors has led some
scholars to suggest that political donors are contributors to the
political polarization seen at almost every level of the politics of the
United States (Francia et al. 2005). This speculation that that
political donors are contributors of polarization is bolstered by the
observation that both political polarization and campaign spending have
risen in conjunction (McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2006). However,
there little evidence for the causal relationship of donors causing
political polarization. And many have concluded that political donations
don't influence polarization (Harden and Kirkland 2016; Raja and Wiltse
2012; Keena and Knight-Finley 2019). Furthermore, it is likely the case
that the causal arrow flows the other direction, and it is more
polarized candidates and electorate that have led to more polarized
donors (Harden and Kirkland 2016; Raja and Wiltse 2012; Keena and
Knight-Finley 2019).

Studying polarization, particularly among political donors can be
difficult because of the myriad of potential confounding factors that
can contribute to polarization (Harden and Kirkland 2016). In addition,
polarization is generally a phenomenon that gradually increases or
decreases over time (Center 2017). However, this paper leverages a
singular event, former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's proposition and
passage of Act 10, a ``budget repair bill'' that ended collective
bargaining for teachers unions and the subsequent protests and recall
election, to examine political donor polarization in the state of
Wisconsin. Given the recent research which has pointed to the
polarization of political donors as being \emph{reactive} instead of
\emph{causal} to broader polarization, we could expect political donors
to follow the trend of voters and polarize after introduction of Act 10
and subsequent events.

\textbf{H1: Political donors in the State of Wisconsin polarized during
the 2011-2012 election cycle compared to the 2009-2010 election cycle
and maintained their level of polarization in the 2013-2014 election
cycle.}

Alternatively, if political donors are contributors to polarization we
would expect to see hypothesis 2.

\textbf{H2: Polarization levels stays the same from 2009-2010 compared
to 2011-2012--suggesting that political donors helped create an
environment in which such a polarizing event could take place.}

In addition, this paper makes a methodological contribution to the field
of political polarization studies by taking a network approach to
measuring polarization to similar to studies of congressional
polarization (Waugh et al., n.d., @zhang2008) and polarization in social
media networks (Guerra et al. 2013; Garcia et al. 2015; Conover et al.
2011). This paper conceives of the political donor landscape of donors
and candidates acting as nodes who are connected by donations made that
act as edges. This method is important in studying political donor
networks because it takes into consideration real-world actions, such as
in the study of polarization among member of congress where voting
records (Guerra et al. 2013) and co-sponsorships (Zhang et al. 2008) are
used to study polarization opposed to surveys administered to donors
that rely on self-reported ideology and partisanship.

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

All data on political contributions came from the Wisconsin Campaign
Finance Information System (CFIS). I exported all contributions to State
Assembly, State Senate, and Gubernatorial races from the 2010, 2012, and
2014 elections. This dataset does not include donations to party
committees, although it does include disbursements from these
committees. I manually created a table of the parties of each of all the
campaigns receiving contributions in this timeframe and added the party
of the campaign receiving the donation to this dataset.

I started with \_\_\_ donations. To clean the data, I filtered out
unitemized/ anonymous donations, removed punctuation from the names of
the donors, and used Open Refine via the \texttt{refiner} R package to
standardize names (for example, Jim versus James). Next, I created a
unique identifier for donors by combining their standardized name with
their zip code. This identifier was created to be able to link donors
who contributed across multiple campaigns in multiple years without
considering two different people, with the same name, from different
locations to be the same person.

Next, I derived the partisanship of each donor in each election cycle. I
calculated each donor's partisanship by taking the percent of donations
that each donor gave to Republicans divided by their donations to
Republicans and Democrats. I took that ``percent donated to
Republicans'' and rescaled it from -1 to 1, where -1 represents the most
Democratic donors, and 1 the most Republican donors. I also calculated
each individual's party bin: if more than 75\% of donations were to
Democrats, they were labeled as a Democrat; if more than 75\% of
donations were to Republicans, they were labeled as a Republican; if
their donations were somewhere inbetween, they were labeled as being a
bipartisan donor.

To quantify the levels of polarization in each election cycle, I
calculated two statistics: network modularity and average absolute
partisanship of donors.

First, political donations can be thought of as a network where donors
and candidates are nodes and donations connecting donors and candidates
are edges. This conceptualization of the political donor landscape as
network allows us to examine the network structure and calculate network
statistics on the graph of donors and candidates. One of the most useful
network statistics for measuring polarization in a network's modularity.

The modularity of a graph measures how good the division of groups (such
as political parties) is by calculating ``the number of edges falling
within groups minus the expected number in an equivalent network with
edges placed at random''
(\url{https://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8577}). The modularity of a
network falls in range {[}need latex{]} {[}-1/2, 1{]}. If the modularity
is positive, the number of edges that remain within each group is
greater than the expected number to remain in-group based on chance. The
higher the modularity, the greater the concentration of edges within
each groups. In other words, the higher the modularity of a network, the
higher the polarization among the groups.

I calculated the modularity of the network graphs of each election cycle
(2010, 2012, 2014). I used candidates' declared parties and donors'
party bin as the groups for the modularity calculation. The modularity
of the network graph of each election is in Table 1.

In addition to calculating the change in modularity of each of the
election cycles, I also analyzed the change in mean absolute
partisanship of the donors in each election cycle.

I defined a donor's absolute partisanship as the absolute value of their
partisanship score (which is on a scale from -1 to 1). Therefore, the
larger a donor's absolute the partisanship, the higher percentage of
their money that they contributed to a single party. To calculate the
significance in the difference of the mean absolute partisanship, I use
a bootstrap methodology with 1000 replications. The results of the
bootstrap are found in Table 2.
