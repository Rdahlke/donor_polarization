\noindent Since the 2012 recall election of Governor Scott Walker, political
polarization in Wisconsin has become a major topic in Wisconin's
politics. Mass polarization among Wisconsin's electorate is well
documented. However, there is little research done on polarization of
political donors and the policy implications of donor polarization. This
study intends to fill this research gap by studying networks of
political donors in Wisconsin. I use data from the Wisconsin Campaign
Finance Information System, Wisconsin's official campaign finance
database, to create networks of donors to candidates for Wisconsin's
state-wide and state-legislative races. By using community modularity, I
empirically show that Republican and Democratic donor networks polarized
in the 2012 election cycle during the recall election of Scott Walker
and remained polarized in the 2014 election cycle in which Governor
Walker was reelected. I also validate these results using a
non-parametric bootrapping method. I discuss the implications of this
conclusion \_\_\_\_\_\_

\section{Wisconsin: A State Divided}\label{wisconsin-a-state-divided}}

The Marquette University Law School Poll have referred to their polling
in Wisconsin as a sharp divide that is ``a lesson in the two worlds of
Wisconsin''--the world of Democrats and another of Republicans. With
polarization being an integral aspect of politics in Wisconsin and
nationawide, they find that ``it seems often as if people have not only
differing opinions but differing views of facts and realities'' (Borsuk
2017).

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

All data on political contributions came from the Wisconsin Campaign
Finance Information System (CFIS). I exported all contributions to State
Assembly, State Senate, and Gubernatorial races from the 2010, 2012, and
2014 elections. This dataset does not include donations to party
committees, although it does include disbursements from these
committees. I manually created a table of the parties of each of all the
campaigns receiving contributions in this timeframe and added the party
of the campaign receiving the donation to this dataset.

I started with \_\_\_ donations. To clean the data, I filtered out
unitemized/ anonymous donations, removed punctuation from the names of
the donors, and used Open Refine via the \texttt{refiner} R package to
standardize names (for example, Jim versus James). Next, I created a
unique identifier for donors by combining their standardized name with
their zip code. This identifier was created to be able to link donors
who contributed across multiple campaigns in multiple years without
considering two different people, with the same name, from different
locations to be the same person.

Next, I derived the partisanship of each donor in each election cycle. I
calculated each donor's partisanship by taking the percent of donations
that each donor gave to Republicans divided by their donations to
Republicans and Democrats. I took that ``percent donated to
Republicans'' and rescaled it from -1 to 1, where -1 represents the most
Democratic donors, and 1 the most Republican donors. I also calculated
each individual's party bin: if more than 75\% of donations were to
Democrats, they were labeled as a Democrat; if more than 75\% of
donations were to Republicans, they were labeled as a Republican; if
their donations were somewhere inbetween, they were labeled as being a
bipartisan donor.

To quantify the levels of polarization in each election cycle, I
calculated two statistics: network modularity and average absolute
partisanship of donors.

First, political donations can be thought of as a network where donors
and candidates are nodes and donations connecting donors and candidates
are edges. This conceptualization of the political donor landscape as
network allows us to examine the network structure and calculate network
statistics on the graph of donors and candidates. One of the most useful
network statistics for measuring polarization in a network's modularity.

The modularity of a graph measures how good the division of groups (such
as political parties) is by calculating ``the number of edges falling
within groups minus the expected number in an equivalent network with
edges placed at random''
(\url{https://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8577}). The modularity of a
network falls in range {[}need latex{]} {[}-1/2, 1{]}. If the modularity
is positive, the number of edges that remain within each group is
greater than the expected number to remain in-group based on chance. The
higher the modularity, the greater the concentration of edges within
each groups. In other words, the higher the modularity of a network, the
higher the polarization among the groups.

I calculated the modularity of the network graphs of each election cycle
(2010, 2012, 2014). I used candidates' declared parties and donors'
party bin as the groups for the modularity calculation. The modularity
of the network graph of each election is in Table 1.

In addition to calculating the change in modularity of each of the
election cycles, I also analyzed the change in mean absolute
partisanship of the donors in each election cycle.

I defined a donor's absolute partisanship as the absolute value of their
partisanship score (which is on a scale from -1 to 1). Therefore, the
larger a donor's absolute the partisanship, the higher percentage of
their money that they contributed to a single party. To calculate the
significance in the difference of the mean absolute partisanship, I use
a bootstrap methodology with 1000 replications. The results of the
bootstrap are found in Table 2.
